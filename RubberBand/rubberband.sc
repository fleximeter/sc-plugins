// RubberBandPS is a phase vocoder based pitch shifter using the Rubber Band 
// library. The difference between this and the RubberBandStretcher implementation
// is that it uses the RubberBandLiveShifter, which has a shorter start delay
// for pitch shifting.

// For obvious reasons, the timeRatio cannot be lower than 1.0 and will be
