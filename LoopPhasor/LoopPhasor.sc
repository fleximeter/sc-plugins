// Description:
// This is a SuperColllider UGen based on the Phasor class.
// It allows setting loop start and end points for playing samples.
// This is useful for mimicking the functionality of commercial sampler synthesizers.

// LoopPhasor is a variant of Phasor with the following changes:
// 1. It has an embedded loop with start and end position (for playing samples with loop points).
//    This allows the LoopPhasor to be used for playing a Buffer normally, and then you only loop within a subset of the Buffer. 
// 2. There are two triggers. One is a trigger for returning to the start position. The other triggers an end to the looping behavior.
